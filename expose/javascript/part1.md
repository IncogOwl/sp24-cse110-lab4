Q1. values added:  20

Q2. final result:  20

Q3. values added:  20

Q4. There is a reference error because result is not defined outside the if block. Since we use let, due to its block scope, result is restricted to the if-block thus result is not referenced or intialized in the else block, thus we get an error.

O5. Error, since we tried to reassign the value of result to num1+num2, it gave us an error as result was declared with a const keyword thus it cannot be changed. 

Q6. Error, since we tried to reassign the value of result to num1+num2, it gave us an error as result was declared with a const keyword thus it cannot be changed. Thus there is an error as sumValues is run with a true value thus the line with the proposed changed is compiled leading to the error as shown above.
